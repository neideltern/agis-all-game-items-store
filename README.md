![cover image](assets/nexus/agis_cover.jpg)
## Description
A collection of Virtual Atelier stores containing (almost) all in-game items, organized into product groups, and presented as immersive websites of brands and corpos within Cyberpunk 2077 universe.

_The stores are divided into two separate archives:_

**A.G.I.S. - PUBLICNET:** A collection of stores designed in the style of in-game corporations and brands, offering items available for purchase in the vanilla version of the game.

**A.G.I.S. - BLACKWALL:** A collection of stores designed in the style of blackwall (darknet) websites associated with various in-game gangs, selling items that are not available for purchase, such as iconic versions of weapons, cyberware etc.

## Prices rebalance
_**NOTE!** Prices rebalance affects my Virtual Atelier stores only_

The economy of Cyberpunk 2077 is completely broken. Based on this, I made a complete rebalance of prices for most of the groups of items. The prices presented below have been randomized by 10% to make the prices look more and varied.
